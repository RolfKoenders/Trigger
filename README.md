# Trigger

I started with the idea of writing the Node.js EventEmitter for the client side, but it didn't really worked out. I ended up with the Observer pattern. Its usable at the client side. When i got something more in the direction of the EventEmitter i will put it up!

## Use it

Observer pattern in Javascript to use at the client side.
