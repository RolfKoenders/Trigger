# Trigger

I started with the idea of writing the Node.js EventEmitter for the client side, but it didn't really worked out. I ended up with the Observer pattern. Its usable at the client side. When i got something more in the direction of the EventEmitter i will put it up!

## Install

Trigger is available in the [bower](http://bower.io) repository under the name of 'TriggerJS' (Trigger was already in use)

Install bower

```
npm install -g bower
```

After its installed you can add 'triggerjs' to your bower.json file and update the packages or install it directly by running

```
bower install triggerjs --save
```


## Usage

In the examples folder there is as you probably already guessed an example. There is not an example of it just yet but the library is **AMD/RequireJS** compatible.
